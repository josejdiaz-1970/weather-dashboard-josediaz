# Reflections for Week 11

## Name: Jose Diaz

## GitHub Username: josejdiaz-1970

# Preferred Feature Track	Data / Visual / Interactive / Smart

## Visual

Team Interest	Yes / No — If Yes: Project Owner or Contributor

Convoluted question. It depends on team members and if we synergize. 
If we don't then I prefer to work alone. If on a good team, then I would be 
happy being a contributor.

Section 1:

Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals and expectations?

I learned about the specific requirements for the capstone. I also learned more about the MVC 
model by seeing it in practice in class. 

Concept Connections: Which Week 1–10 skills feel strongest? Which need more practice?

The strongest skills I feel now are the basic ones such as data structures early on. I also feel
comfortable with basic GUI design and implementation. However, even though I feel comfortable with
it, GUI implementation is one I need a lot of practice with.

Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)?

The first blocker was where do I start. We had an idea of the capstone, but no idea how to begin. The guidance
document provided by Asha and staff ahas proved really helpful.
No blockers at this stage. However, I am going a bit ahead and starting to implement the core in
the Model View Controller form. This has produced my first blockers.

Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward?

I can only attend either late office hours after class or on weekends. I have attended a few of these.
I can also make use of resources such as w3schools, StackOverflow, or chatGPT.

Section 2:

Three features I plan to build.

1. Theme Switcher **
2. Weather Icons **
3. Tomorrow's Guess ***

Enhancement: I am undecided between, sound effects or my own descriptions. An enhancement I would love to make is to display a weather quote from some famous person, or a scifi show, or a joke(probably from Lewis Black)

Section 3:

Section 4: 

I'm storing to a csv file. My plan is to store the entire API call since it isn't that much data.
I'll use the keys as headers and the values of course will be the data.

Example:

I havent decided how much data to include from the API so this is very much subject to change.

name country lat lon main descritption...id
San Juan,PR,-66.0917,18.451,Clouds,scattered clouds...4568153

Section 5: 

Because of my work schedule, most of these activities will only be worked on for  about a half hour to
an hour after class and then most of the work will occur on the weekends. So in the calendar the weekedays
are when I plan to start the tasks. 

Week	Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	    Thursday	Weekend                 Key Milestone
11       ----    ----   File Structure  API Setup   Initial Tkinter shell            
12	    API setup	Error handling	Tkinter shell	Buffer day	Basic working app
13	    Feature 1	Integrate	Feature 1 complete
14	    Feature 2 start	Review & test	Finish	Feature 2 complete
15	    Feature 3	Polish UI	Error passing	Refactor	All features complete
16	    Enhancement	Docs	Tests	Packaging	Ready-to-ship app
17	    Rehearse	Buffer	Showcase	–	Demo Day

Section 6:

Risks:                  Likelihood          Mitigation

Time availability       Medium              Planning and setting aside most of the weekend for this project.
                                            In addition to doing small pieces during the week.

GUI design              Medium/High         I know to design basic GUIs but this requires more skill. I will
                                            be doing a lot of document reading.                                                              

Test creation           Medium              Get help from resources on test creation and implementation.

MVC implementation      Medium              Read documents, watch tutorials and ask AI.

Section 7:

Not really sure, it depends on the issue I am stuck in. usually I get stuck when I jump the gun on coding
before planning and I panic. Probably office hours will help me "get off the ledge".
