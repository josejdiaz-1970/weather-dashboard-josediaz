Personalization: Add random quotes based on the weather conditions. Make them funny. Random.
Also, I realized based on my past assignments, that I need make a plan for this app FIRST before coding. So over the next few days I'm focusing on that in addition to getting the core done.

Added some basic GUI components and started to frame out the GUI in MVC style. Needed some help from chatGPT for this.
To Do:

1. Need to get city data to the LoadAPI and then back to the gui window
2. Need to dave data into a csv file: Copy that part from week 10 assignment.

Added save data functionality and fixed a lot of the back and forth with data to and from main.

To Do:

1. Fix the gui so that text is not displayed in a text box.
2. Clean up gui so that colors can be switched by theme switcher.
