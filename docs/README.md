## TPS25 Capstone Project

# Overview:

This program is a weather app for the TPS25 capstone project. It reads weather 
data from an API (https://openweathermap.org/current) and displays it on the screen. 

# How to use:

*See **user_guide.md***

# Current files:

1. **main.py** - This is the main program which calls the API, gets the data, and transfers it to the GUI.
It is planned that most requests that involve acquisition or storage of data will go through main.

2. **weather_gui.py** - The frontend of the app. Will display data based on the city selected.
And allow for data to be saved to a text file.

3. **config.py** - Currently not used.

4. **data/** folder - Where all relevant data will be stored.

5. **features/** folder - Future feature files and enhancements will live here.
